Docklands is a modern harbour development dominated by high-rises and the colourful Melbourne Star Observation Wheel, and popular for its shopping and waterside dining. The area's pedestrian plazas are adorned with public murals, sculpture and light displays. Families head to concerts and sports at Etihad Stadium, and to Harbour Town's mini-golf and sports car simulators.

This is walk in docklands during lunch time, I started from Victoria Harbour Promenade and walked all the way to the end of Newquay Promenade.
